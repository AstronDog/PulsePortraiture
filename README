What it is:
    -a wideband pulsar timing code written in python. It uses an extension of
    Joe Taylor's FFTFIT algorithm (Taylor 1992) to simultaneously measure a
    phase (TOA) and dispersion measure (DM).  It is to be used with
    PSRCHIVE-compatible folded archives.

Why:
    -The motivation behind writing this software was to develop a wideband
    timing routine for high-precision pulsar timing, and it makes up a chunk of
    Tim Pennucci's Ph.D. thesis.  Algorithm development and coding help was
    provided by Paul Demorest and Scott Ransom.

The technical description of this work is:
    -Pennucci, Demorest, & Ransom (2014), "Elementary Wideband Timing of Radio
        Pulsars" (arXiv:1402:1672),
    and has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

Requirements:
    -PSRCHIVE, compiled with the python-interface enabled
    -at least numpy 1.7.1 & scipy 0.12.0
    -lmfit is required for portrait modelling.

In short:
    -pplib contains all functions and classes needed for the fitting scripts.
    -ppgauss is a command-line utility to build gaussian-component model
        portraits.
    -pptoas is a command-line utility to measure TOAs and DMs.

Other:
    -Full documentation/docstrings coming soon; examples/example.py can be run
    as a demonstration.  Code improvements are underway, as is a broad
    application to IPTA pulsars of interest.  Suggestions and additional
    development are welcome (https://github.com/pennucci/PulsePortraiture).
